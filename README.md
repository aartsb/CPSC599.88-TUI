Project 0: Candle Tricks!

Concept: A pushbutton is used as a switch to control the flickering and fading of the candle (LEDs) while also playing some soothing songs as the candle is lit. The button is used to toggle from one state to the other depending on the individual's mood to see a certain kind of flicker/fading (agressive/calming) and to hear a well-fitted song that goes with the flickering and fading of the candle.

Note: pitches.h is a file that I used to create my songs/tunes using some common pitch values. Credit: Brett Hagman for writing this note table.
